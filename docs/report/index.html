    <h2><span>1.</span> Abstract</h2>
    <p>
      In this document we will present the internal data models to be used and the external data sources managed
      by the Web application which we will implement.
    </p>

    <h2><span>2.</span> Introduction</h2>
    <p>
      Data visualization refers to the techniques used to communicate information from data through
      visual representation. Its main purpose is to distill large data sets into visual graphics
      to allow an easy understanding of the complex relationships within the data. It is often used in a way
      interchangeable with terms such as informational graphics, statistical graphics and information
      visualization.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is one of the steps in the data science process developed by Joe Blitzstein, who is a
      framework to address the tasks of data science. After the data is collected, processed and modeled,
      relationships must be visualized so that a conclusion can be drawn.
    </p>
    <p>
      For this reason, planning the models used in the Web application is an important process for the user to
      benefit from the best information when accessing the web page.
    </p>
  </section>
  <section id="context">
    <h2><span>3.</span> Context of Use</h2>
    <p>
      The context of use is the real conditions in which a given software product is used or will be used
      in a normal daily work situation.
    </p>
    <p>
      COVID-19 data for all site is an evolving software product that provides the latest data
      for the entire population of the planet about the latest statistics on the global spread of the virus.
      Users who access this community have access to the latest information about coronavirus, such as:
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>Cases, deaths and the number of total healed</li>
      <li>Information on how the virus spreads</li>
      <li>Information about the symptoms of the virus</li>
      <li>Information about the evolution of the virus</li>
      <li>Predictions about the evolution of the virus for the next few days.</li>
    </ul>
  </section>
  <section id="utilizatori">
    <h2><span>4.</span> Main Audience</h2>
    <p>
      The sites about coronavirus are the most used sites in the last year. How virus can affect anyone, the site
      is accessed mainly by a majority of the globe with access at the Internet.
    </p>
  </section>
  <section id="internal">
    <h2><span>5.</span>Internal Data Models</h2>
    <p>
      The Web application developed by us has two types of users, those who manage the page and the public one who
      can access information about coronavirus.
    </p>
    <p>
      Administrators are the ones who can add new coronavirus cases, tips against the virus and the latest virus
      information to the application. To add a new coronavirus case, the administrator must add the following
      information: the day the case was reported, the person's gender, age, location, and other relevant data.
      To add new virus advice or information, the administrator must add a title, description, and certain tags to
      make them easier to be found.
    </p>

    <p>
      Here you can see the model for adding a new case of coronavirus.
    </p>
    <p>
      A person who visits the web page can view statistics about the evolution of the virus or predictions for the
      next days of the virus over a certain period of time, over a certain age range, location, gender or
      different tags. Below you can see a model of an evolution.
    </p>
    <img alt
      class="desktop-image"

    <p>
      A user can also look for some tips for preventing the virus based on a title or certain tags.

  <section id="external">
    <h2><span>6.</span> External Data Sources</h2>
    <p>
      External data is data that is not collected by us. This data would be obtained from a source outside of our
      project. For a start we thought of using the Apify API which gives us information about coronavirus from a
      selected country.
    </p>

  <section id="linked">
    <h2><span>7.</span> Linked Data Principles</h2>
    <p>
      Our application conforms with the linked data principles because we use RDF and for a specific URI the
      application will create a query that provides useful information about what the user was looking for.
      We use URI as names for things, and users will use HTTP URIs to search for some informations.
    </p>
  </section>
  <section id="progress">
    <h2><span>8.</span> Project Progress</h2>
    <p>
      From the beginning of the implementation of this project we planned to develop a series of functionalities
      that would offer users a perspective on the data related to COVID-19. These functionalities would be:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Information about global cases on a period of time</li>
      <li>Information about global test performed on a period of time </li>
      <li>Information about global deaths on a period of time</li>
      <li>Information about local cases on a period of time</li>
      <li>Information about local test performed on a period of time </li>
      <li>Information about local deaths on a period of time</li>
      <li>Leaderboards with countries with most cases</li>
      <li>Informations about history, spread, symptoms and protections</li>
      <li>A neuronal network system that will calculate de number of cases for a period of time</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      For the most part, we followed the plan and implemented all the functionalities, only we made small compromises.
      In some parts we did not respect the initial design and on the home page we gave up some graphics.

  <section id="apis">
    <h2><span>9.</span> API Layers</h2>
    <section id="apis-evolution">
      <h3><span>9.1</span> API Layers - Evolution</h2>
        <p>
          First APIs implemented are those needed for showing the data on the Home tab. Here the user can analyze some
          charts
          regarding the evolution of the virus in a period of time globally or specific for some countries.

        <section id="apis-prediction-public">
          <h4><span>9.2.1</span> API Layers - Prediction - Public</h4>
          <p>
            The Prediction API will the take care of orchestrating and feeding data to the internal API. it will also
            handle client requests and data parsing from and to the internal API.
          </p>

        <section>
          <h4><span>9.2.1</span> API Layers - Prediction - Internal</h4>
            Here we have an Internal API build specifically for predicting cases based on a loopback. Inside this API 
            we also have a project where we can train another model or improve it. We use a LongShortTermMemory neural network with a Loopback of 14.
            This API Is hosted using flask and only serves a getPrediction endpoint.

    <section id="apis-support">
      <h3><span>9.3</span> API Layers - Support</h2>
      <p>
        The Support set of APIs returns data about spread, symptoms and protections to the user.

  <section id="deployment">
    <h2><span>10.</span>Deployment</h2>
    The entire system is deployed on azure
    <br>
     - one react static client under a NET .Core MVC 5 in a Azure AppService.
    <br>
     - one flask API as internal
    <br>
