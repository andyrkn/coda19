            In this document we will present the internal data models to be used and the external data sources managed

        <h2><span>2.</span> Introduction</h2>
        <p>
            Data visualization refers to the techniques used to communicate information from data through
            visual representation. Its main purpose is to distill large data sets into visual graphics
            to allow an easy understanding of the complex relationships within the data. It is often used in a way
            interchangeable with terms such as informational graphics, statistical graphics and information
            visualization.
        </p>
        <p>
            It is one of the steps in the data science process developed by Joe Blitzstein, who is a
            framework to address the tasks of data science. After the data is collected, processed and modeled,
            relationships must be visualized so that a conclusion can be drawn.
        </p>
        <p>
            For this reason, planning the models used in the Web application is an important process for the user to
            benefit from the best information when accessing the web page.

        <h2><span>3.</span> Context of Use</h2>
        <p>
            The context of use is the real conditions in which a given software product is used or will be used
            in a normal daily work situation.
        </p>
        <p>
            COVID-19 data for all site is an evolving software product that provides the latest data
            for the entire population of the planet about the latest statistics on the global spread of the virus.
            Users who access this community have access to the latest information about coronavirus, such as:
        </p>

        <ul>
            <li>Cases, deaths and the number of total healed</li>
            <li>Information on how the virus spreads</li>

            The sites about coronavirus are the most used sites in the last year. How virus can affect anyone, the site
            is accessed mainly by a majority of the globe with access at the Internet.

            The Web application developed by us has two types of users, those who manage the page and the public one who
            can access information about coronavirus.
        </p>
        <p>
            Administrators are the ones who can add new coronavirus cases, tips against the virus and the latest virus
            information to the application. To add a new coronavirus case, the administrator must add the following
            information: the day the case was reported, the person's gender, age, location, and other relevant data.
            To add new virus advice or information, the administrator must add a title, description, and certain tags to
            make them easier to be found.

            A person who visits the web page can view statistics about the evolution of the virus or predictions for the

        <h2><span>6.</span> External Data Sources</h2>
        <p>
            External data is data that is not collected by us. This data would be obtained from a source outside of our
            project. For a start we thought of using the Apify API which gives us information about coronavirus from a
            selected country.

        <h2><span>7.</span> Linked Data Principles</h2>
        <p>
            Our application conforms with the linked data principles because we use RDF and for a specific URI the
            application will create a query that provides useful information about what the user was looking for.
            We use URI as names for things, and users will use HTTP URIs to search for some informations.
        </p>
        <p>
            We gather most of our data from the <a href="https://github.com/owid/covid-19-data">OurWorldInData</a>
            source.
            We have implemented parses which can automatically take in the necessary data inside our Coda19.Reader
            project.

                    This graph covers all the possible locations in our system, identified by a continent and a country.
                    The ID of the graph is represented by the country code.

                    Location, and one for Date. We decided to create a sparql prefix for date as well, for easier
                    querying.

                    The id is automatically generated on insertion inside our project.

            <h3><span>7.2</span> SparQL Usage</h3>
            <p>
                In order to have a good experience using SparQL across 4 APIs, we've decided the best course
                of action would be to implement a mechanism which would allow us to send queries and commands in the
                easiest way.
            </p>
            <p>
                With this reason in mind we built the <b>SparqlQueryBuilder</b> and the <b>SparqlUpdateBuilder</b>. They
                allow
                us to create through code all the queries in commands in a simple and explicit way, hiding all the
                SparQL
                behind the scenes. Ofcourse, a level of SparQL knowledge is still needed to understand the concepts of
                subject,
                predicate and literal.

        <p>
            From the beginning of the implementation of this project we planned to develop a series of functionalities
            that would offer users a perspective on the data related to COVID-19. These functionalities would be:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Information about global cases on a period of time</li>
            <li>Information about global test performed on a period of time </li>
            <li>Information about global deaths on a period of time</li>
            <li>Information about local cases on a period of time</li>
            <li>Information about local test performed on a period of time </li>
            <li>Information about local deaths on a period of time</li>
            <li>Leaderboards with countries with most cases</li>
            <li>Informations about history, spread, symptoms and protections</li>
            <li>A neuronal network system that will calculate de number of cases for a period of time</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            For the most part, we followed the plan and implemented all the functionalities, only we made small
            compromises.
            In some parts we did not respect the initial design and on the home page we gave up some graphics.
